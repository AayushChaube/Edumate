I created a student management software, in which students can register himself/herself. Once registered, the student can login and submit their performance details for the semester which includes their subject names, marks scored and credits. The system then evaluates the data entered to generate the CGPI and percentage for the student.

Modules:
  1. Login
  2. Registration
  3. Welcome Screen
  4. Marks Input
  5. DIsplay CGPI

Technologies:
  1. Python (For Front-end)
  2. MySQL (For Back-end Database)

Tools:
  1. Anaconda Navigator (Spyder IDE)
  2. Wampserver (phpMyAdmin)
