I created a a student management software, in which students can register himself/herself. Once registered, the student an login and submit their performance details for the semster which includes their subject names, marks scored and credits. The system then evaluates the data entered to generate the CGPI and percentage for the student.

  2. Registration
  3. Welcome Screen
  4. Marks Input
  5. DIsplay CGPI

Technologies:

  2. MySQL (For Back-end Database)
